== Test the deployment

After the Quick Start CloudFormation stack is created, do these steps:

.  In the https://aws.amazon.com/console[AWS Management Console^], open the newly created https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9[AWS Cloud9^] environment.
.  Change a property value in the *props.yaml* file in any one of the nested directories in the *quick-start/res/* directory. For example, you can change the build server type from **BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL** to **BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM**, as seen in the following image.

NOTE: The first time the Quick Start is launched, the pipeline runs automatically. You can approve it and let it continue completing, as it will not update anything.
