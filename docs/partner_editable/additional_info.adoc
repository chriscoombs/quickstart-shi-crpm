== Test the deployment

.  Wait for the Quick Start CloudFormation stack to finish being created.
.  In the https://aws.amazon.com/console[AWS Console^], open the newly created https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9[AWS Cloud9^] environment.
.  Then, try changing some property value in any *props.yaml* file in one of the nested directories in *quick-start/res/*. For example, you could change the build server type from **BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL** to **BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM** as seen in the screenshot below.

. In the https://aws.amazon.com/console[AWS Console^], open the https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline[AWS CodePipeline^] that was created.  Then, scroll down to the **Review** stage, click the **Review** button, enter a message, and click the **Approve** button as seen in the screenshot below.
+
NOTE: The first time the Quick Start is launched, the pipeline will run automatically.  You can approve it and let it continue completing, as it will not update anything.
