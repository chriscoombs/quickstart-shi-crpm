The Quick Start creates a CI/CD infrastructure that is integrated with {partner-product-short-name}. The architecture is designed to watch itself for changes. When changes are made to the properties that define the pipeline, the pipeline is updated. The infrastructure code is hosted in AWS CodeCommit and cloned in an AWS Cloud9 environment. AWS CDK code is used with {partner-product-short-name} property files.

Managing cloud resources includes managing the properties of the resources. https://shi.github.io/crpm[CRPM^] helps organize the properties by importing .yaml files, which are stitched together with AWS CDK.  
{partner-product-short-name} keeps properties that are ideal for YAML in .yaml files, and puts all the logic into structured AWS CDK code. By keeping the properties organized, users can build a complex infrastructure while keeping technical debt to a minimum.
