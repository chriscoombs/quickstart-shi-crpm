The Quick Start demonstrates how to create CI/CD infrastructure that watches itself for changes.
When changes are made to the properties that define the pipeline, the pipeline is updated.
The infrastructure code is hosted in AWS CodeCommit and cloned in an AWS Cloud9 environment for
ease of use.  AWS CDK code is used in conjunction with {partner-product-short-name} property files.

Managing cloud resources ultimately boils down to managing properties.  [CRPM](https://shi.github.io/crpm)
(Cloud Resource Property Manager) helps organize all of those properties by importing bite-sized YAML files,
which are stitched together with AWS CDK.  It keeps all of what's good about YAML in YAML, and shoves all of the
unsightly logic into beautiful CDK code.  By focusing on keeping properties well organized, you can build
complex infrastructure while keeping technical debt to a minimum.
