// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides one deployment option:

* *Deploy infrastructure built with {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions an IDE with {partner-product-short-name} along with a CI/CD pipeline in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides a template for this option.
